<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database.  The database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value.  Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length.  Both binary data and character string can be used as a key and a value.  Each key must be unique within a database.  There is neither concept of data tables nor data types.  Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.</p>

<p>Kyoto Cabinet is developed as the successor of QDBM on the following purposes.  They are achieved and Kyoto Cabinet replaces conventional DBM products.</p>

<ul>
<li>improves space efficiency : smaller size of database file.</li>
<li>improves time efficiency : faster processing speed.</li>
<li>improves parallelism : higher performance in multi-thread environment.</li>
<li>improves usability : simplified API.</li>
<li>improves robustness : database file is not corrupted even under catastrophic situation.</li>
<li>supports 64-bit architecture : enormous memory space and database file are available.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compared with the sibling product, Tokyo Cabinet, the following advantages are pursued.  However, the performance of Tokyo Cabinet is higher than Kyoto Cabinet, at least in single thread operations.</p>

<ul>
<li>improves space efficiency : smaller size of database file.</li>
<li>improves parallelism : higher performance in multi-thread environment.</li>
<li>improves portability : abstraction of the lower layer to support non-POSIX systems.</li>
<li>improves usability : simplified API, object-oriented design.</li>
<li>improves robustness : database file is not corrupted even under catastrophic situation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kyoto Cabinet is written in the C++ language, and provided as API of C++.  Kyoto Cabinet is available on platforms which have API conforming to C++03 with the TR1 library extensions.  Kyoto Cabinet is a free software licensed under the GNU General Public License.</p>

<p><em>As for now, the development status is still alpha.  We need thorough test and feedback.  The API and the file format will be modified anytime soon.</em></p>
